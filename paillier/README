1. To extract the libraries:
    tar xzfv libpaillier-0.8.tar.gz
    tar xzfj gmp-6.1.0.tar.bz2

2. To install the libraries:
    ./configure
    make
    make install (may require sudo mode)

3. Compiling "routine" programs:
    When the libraries are successfully installed, compilation will require the following flags: -lgmp -lpaillier
    Provided Makefile already takes care of this.

4. Compiling SUM_HE shared lirary:
    IMPORTANT: libpaillier is not PIC-ready out-of-the-box.
    In order to make it compatible with shared libraries, redo step 2 but after running "./configure",
    manually add "-fPIC" flag into the generated Makefile.
