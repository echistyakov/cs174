1. To extract the libraries:
    tar xvfz libpaillier-0.8.tar.gz
    tar xvfj gmp-6.1.0.tar.bz2

2. To install the libraries:
    ./configure
    make
    make install (may require sudo mode)
    
   *gmp requires m4 package to be installed.
   *paillier requires gmp to be installed.

3. Compiling "routine" programs:
    When the libraries are successfully installed, compilation will require the following flags: -lgmp -lpaillier
    Provided Makefile already takes care of this.

4. Compiling SUM_HE shared lirary:
    IMPORTANT: libpaillier-0.8 is not PIC-ready out-of-the-box.
    In order to make it compatible with shared libraries, redo step 2 but after running "./configure",
    manually add "-fPIC" flag to CFLAGS in the generated Makefile.

5. Copy shared library to MySQL plugins folder:
    cp sum_he.so /usr/lib/mysql/plugin (may require sudo mode)

6. Register SUM_HE with MySQL:
    CREATE AGGREGATE FUNCTION sum_he RETURNS STRING SONAME 'sum_he.so';
   
  *To drop:
    DROP FUNCTION sum_he;
